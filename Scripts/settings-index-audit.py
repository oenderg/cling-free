"""Keep the MCP settings bridge honest about what Cling actually has.

The bridge in Cling/MCPSettings.swift is hand-maintained, and nothing in the compiler notices when it
drifts: a new toggle in a Settings pane gets no key an agent can read or write, and a renamed key leaves
a registry entry pointing at nothing. Either way an agent confidently reports a setting that is not
there, or cannot find the one that is.

    Scripts/settings-index-audit.py            # errors only, exit 1 on drift
    Scripts/settings-index-audit.py --coverage # plus which defined keys are not exposed, and why

Errors (exit 1):
  - the registry names a key that no `Defaults.Keys` extension defines
  - a registry entry's name differs from the key it reads, so an agent's key is not the app's
  - a key bound with @Default in a Settings pane is neither in the registry nor listed below with a reason
  - two registry entries share a name
  - a top-level CLI command has no MCP tool and is not listed below with a reason

Cling has no settings search index the way Clop has, so the titles live in the registry itself and
there is nothing else to cross-check.
